# Title: Food processing default coefficients
# Units: Unitless (EJ energy per EJ heat) for supplysector process heat food processing
# Source: From GCAM-USA assumptions for boilers with each of these fuels for all technologies except heat pumps (which are from Rissman 2022) and district heat (assumed to be 1) and technologies paired with solar (solar fraction of energy provided assumed to be 0.2 based on a range from literature, solar efficiency assumed to be 0.6 based on data in the appendix of the report Renewable Energy Options for Industrial Process Heat)
