# Title: Base Year Exogenous Shares for Selected Technologies
# Units: Unitless
# Comments: Base year exogenous shares assigned to selected efficiency-partitioned technologies whose shares are not calculated from aggregate average efficiency.
# Source: Furnace/heat: Annual Energy Outlook, ~2009 edition. Lighting: https://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/publications/pdfs/ssl/lmc_vol1_final.pdf. All other technologies are not partitioned in the base year (i.e., all shares are allocated to the base technology).
