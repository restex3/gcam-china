        # Segment-Specific Tuning in Model Calibration
        # ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        # This section involves year-by-year tuning, which is the most challenging part of the process. The goal is to ensure
        # that all "dominant fuels" (typically coal and hydro) are accurately accounted for in each segment.
        #
        # Key Principles:
        # - This is primarily a manual process that depends on expert judgement.
        # - Tuning for each region is guided by error messages (e.g., "Warning: subpeak demand could not solve.").
        #   These indicate the need for manual adjustments.
        # - The code contains numerous "print" statements to identify issues with specific fuel types, years, or regions.
        #   If a fuel cannot be allocated to a segment due to space constraints, manual adjustments are necessary.
        #
        # Common Scenarios:
        # - Refined liquids and gas are usually allocated to subpeak and peak segments. If a peak segment is fully
        #   occupied by refined liquids, leaving no space for coal, reallocate refined liquids to non-peak segments.
        #
        # Note:
        # - This calibration is crucial for the accurate historical performance of the model but does not impact future
        #   periods. The base/int/subpeak/peak segments are used only for model allocation balance, not for real capacity dispatch.
        # - This approach aligns with the GCAM-USA. For more details, see the "Electricity generation" section in:
        #   https://jgcri.github.io/gcam-doc/gcam-usa.html
        # - Users typically do not need to modify this part, as the current version is already extensively adjusted to make sure
        #   there is no warning (i.e. all fuel/segment/grid have been solved)
